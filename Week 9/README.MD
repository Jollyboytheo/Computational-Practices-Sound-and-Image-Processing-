## Design notes

For this project, we had to make a ball bounce on mouse interaction and also create a game using all of the below:

- at least 1 class
- at least 2 forces influencing the object's movement
- at least 1 type of interaction.

I ended up creating a basketball game that has a moving rim, and the user should try and score as many points as they can before the 1-minute clock runs out.
